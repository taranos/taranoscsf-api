# *Taranos Web APIs* #

### What are Taranos Web APIs?
This project contains specifications and documentation for the canonical web APIs of [_Taranos:CSF_](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf).

> Note:  The Swagger API definition for the Taranos APIs is delayed because of the apparent inability of a commonly
> promoted Swagger editor to correctly handle some of the more deeply nested JSON constructs of the Taranos API
> primitives, which the Swagger standard appears to allow.  At best this is disappointing, at its most annoying it
> questions the entire reason for Swagger's existence.  The author is currently exploring alternative methods for
> expressing the Taranos API in a technically rigorous form.
>
> In the meantime, the best ways to become familiar with the guts of the Taranos API are:
>
> - If you're familiar with Python, check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf/wiki/PAPI-Tutorials) along with the internals of the [Pseudo-API](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-papi) package.
>
> - If you're familiar with Play Framework, check out the routes config file of the [reference server](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-refserver).
