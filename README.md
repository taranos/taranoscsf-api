# *Taranos Web APIs* #

### What are Taranos Web APIs?
This project contains specifications and documentation for the canonical web APIs of [_Taranos:CSF_](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf).

> Note:  The Swagger API definition for the Taranos APIs is delayed because of the apparent inability of a commonly
> promoted Swagger editor to correctly handle some of the more deeply nested JSON constructs of the Taranos API
> primitives, which the Swagger standard appears to allow.  At best this is disappointing, at its most annoying it
> questions the entire reason for Swagger's existence.  The author is currently exploring alternative methods for
> expressing the Taranos API in a technically rigorous form.
