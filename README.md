# *Taranos Web APIs* #

### What are Taranos Web APIs?
This project contains specifications and documentation for the canonical web APIs
of [_Taranos:CSF_](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf).

- Formal OpenAPI specifications are provided within the project repo.  Additional effort has been made to ensure that
the source files are compatible with the [Amazon API Gateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway) import tool.

- If you're familiar with Python you may wish to check out the
[tutorials](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf/wiki/PAPI-Tutorials) along with the internals of the
[Pseudo-API](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-papi) package.

- If you're familiar with Play Framework you may also refer to the routes config file of the
[reference server](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-refserver).
